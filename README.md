AllPeaksProminence
==================

These programs implement algorithms for computing a list of peaks in a
heightmap, sorted by prominence.


prominence1d
------------

This program operates on a one dimensional heightmap. The algorithm is an
online algorithm with a stack. For a heightmap with `m` points and `n` peaks,
its running time is in `O(m + n*log(n))` and its space usage is in `O(n)`.

**Input:**
A one dimensional heightmap presented as whitespace separated pairs of
*position* and *height*. The pairs should be presented in order of increasing
*position*. No empty lines are allowed.

**Output:**
All peaks, sorted by prominence.

### Building

Use `make` in the `prominence1d` directory.


prominence
----------

This program operates on arbitrary graphs. Graphs can be supplied as either
`GraphML` or `DOT` files (using the `boost` backend), with heights specified in
vertex attributes named `height`. Alternatively, a digital elevation model can
be specified as a `DEM` file in a format understood by `GDAL` (using the `gdal`
backend).

**Output:**
All peaks, sorted by prominence.

### Building

Use `make [all | prominence] [backend=(boost | gdal)]` in the `prominence`
directory.

A C++11-compatible compiler and either the `Boost` headers or the `GDAL`
libraries are required for building the program. The default backend is `gdal`.


minprominence
-------------

This program accepts the same input graphs as the `prominence` program. For a
given number of peaks, it finds a selection of that many peaks with a minimum
combined, or, equivalently, average, relative prominence.

**Output:**
A selection of peaks and their combined relative prominence.

### Building

Use `make [all | minprominence] [backend=(boost | gdal)]` in the `prominence`
directory.

This algorithm was conceived by *Rudolf Fleischer* in collaboration with
*Jouke Witteveen*, *Michael Emmerich*, and *GÃ¼nter Rote* at the
*Fixed-Parameter Computational Geometry* workshop 2018, at the *Lorentz Center*
in *Leiden*.
